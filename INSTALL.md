Construir opens up a computer to sandboxed calculation jobs that last for a maximum of two hours and are not allowed to require any kind of internet access.

Jobs are submitted via FTP as disk images, run by a Qemu machine and then copied to the output directory. Output is available for 24 hours after completion.
